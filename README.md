Title: Experimental Deaf Accessibility

The issue with lack of deaf accessibility across the US. I want to change that by adding new guidelines for A11y that included deaf accessibility. Since A11y already have materials for the blind, low vision, voices, and some more. Yet, "According to the 2011 American Community Survey (ACS), about 3.6% of the U.S. population, or about 11 million individuals, consider themselves deaf or have serious difficulty hearing." - https://infoguides.rit.edu/c.php?g=380750&p=2706325

On the education side, "More than 50 percent of D/HH(Deaf and Hard of Hearing) persons have attained only a high school or less than high school education compared to only 40 percent for hearing persons. Twenty-four percent of those who are D/HH are college graduates compared with 39 percent for the hearing population." -https://infoguides.rit.edu/c.php?g=380750&p=2706323 So therefore, that deaf people aren't necessarily well-literate. Since the majority of us have English as our second language and maybe not even proficient in it at all. 

Many government websites are too wordy with English as a base language. Deaf users may not understand them at all or confuse interpretation. Even general websites may seem to be simple but not visual enough to receive cues of things/actions. 

That's why I am taking up this concept as base guidelines for Deaf Accessibility by having a video to make the website even more accessible within A11y guidelines. The video can use for "ASLized"(American Signing Language) description, summary, interpretation, and many more.
